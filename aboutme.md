Hello there,

Welcome to my blog. I am excited to talk about myself. I graduated from UW-Madison with a B.A. in Mathematics and with a minor in Actuarial Science. I took an actuarial technical skill course which covers Microsoft Excel, Access, SQL, and Pivot Table related to Acturial concept capstone projects. I passed the two exams, FM and P1, and I am going to seat for the IFM exam in November 2020. Hence, I am studying data science at Lambda School boot camp and improving my skills in Python, SQL, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Databases, and Statistics & Modeling.

In my entire life, I have enjoyed mathematics, probability, and statistics. I really like playing with numbers, solving problems, learning and expanding my knowledge in math and statistics, and applying them to the real world. This is why, I am really attracted to Actuarial Science an Data Science.

What else do you need to know?

## My History

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer all your questions.
