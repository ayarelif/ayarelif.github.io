Hello there,

Welcome to my blog! I am excited about the opportunity to write about my areas of interests here. A little bit about myself. I have always enjoyed mathematics, probability, and statistics.  I graduated from UW-Madison with a B.A. in Mathematics and a minor in Actuarial Science. I have passed the two Actuarial exams, FM and P1, and I am going to sit for the IFM exam in November 2020. I am currently attending a data science program at Lambda School and improving my skills in Python, SQL, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Databases, and Statistics & Modeling.

I really like playing with numbers, solving problems, learning and expanding my knowledge in math and statistics, and applying them to the real world. This is why I am really attracted to Actuarial Science and Data Science. I intend to write about Actuarial Science and Data Science here in this blog. I hope you are going to enjoy my blog.



Thank you!
