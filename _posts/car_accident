## **Introduction:**

[1–800-The-law-2](https://www.1800thelaw2.com/blog/how-many-car-accidents-us) mentions that;
> "According to the National Highway Traffic Administration, car accidents happen every 60 seconds.
That equates to about 5.25 million accidents across the nation on a yearly basis. Statistics by the Association 
for Safe International Road Travel show that 37,000 people die annually due to vehicular accidents with an additional 
2.35 million either injured or disabled."

The US population is approximately 330 million based on census gov’s publish. I could conclude that approximately 
0.016 % of car accidents happen every year. While only 0.007% of people who made a car accident are losing their 
lives every year, 0.45 % of people are injured or disabled. In other words, on average 1 or 2 people in the US 
make a car accident each year, and there is a 0.016 probability that she/he might die. Otherwise, the probability 
of getting injured or disabled is 0.45% for each person.
