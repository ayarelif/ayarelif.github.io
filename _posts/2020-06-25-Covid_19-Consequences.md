# **Covid-19 Consequences**


## **Introduction:**

Coronavirus (Covid-19 )is a respiratory illness and is the strain discovered at almost the end of the year 2019. There have been many types of coronavirus discovered so far; however, the world has been affected a lot more seriously with the current strain compared to other types of coronaviruses. The first outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, WHO, declared the Public Health Emergency of international concern. Only a few weeks passed over the first outbreak declaration, and WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic and invited all countries to take serious actions on March 11, 2020. There are 8,969,827 total global confirmed cases and 468,576 global death numbers based on the daily report of Johns Hopkins University today. The number is increasing every day. Pandemic has caused global social disruption. Many events around the world have been canceled or postponed. Universities, schools, kids’ playgrounds, businesses, shopping areas, and even worship services of various faiths have been affected by the pandemic, and they have been temporarily closed. Some cities and states even decided to shot down. Our lives have changed. Some have continued working online. Kids have distance education from their homes. We have been informed about how to keep our environment hygienic. Social distance and face masks have been serious steps to protect ourselves from the virus.

To sum up, the whole world has been affected by the pandemic, and lives have been changed. In this article, I will investigate what countries have suffered most from Covid-19 and how people have been affected by the pandemic.


## 1. What countries are mostly suffered by Covid-19?

> NBC news mentions “The new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, which killed around 10 percent of people who became infected. The SARS outbreak was contained within about six months, while the COVID-19 outbreak is only a few months old at this point. Approximately 35 percent of reported patients with MERS died, but there were significantly fewer cases than either SARS or COVID-19 during that outbreak.”/
