# **Covid-19 Consequences**


## **Introduction:**

Coronavirus (Covid-19 )is a respiratory illness and is the strain discovered at almost the end of the year 2019. There have been many types of coronavirus discovered so far; however, the world has been affected a lot more seriously with the current strain compared to other types of coronaviruses. The first outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, WHO, declared the Public Health Emergency of international concern. Only a few weeks passed over the first outbreak declaration, and WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic and invited all countries to take serious actions on March 11, 2020. There are 8,969,827 total global confirmed cases and 468,576 global death numbers based on the daily report of Johns Hopkins University today. The number is increasing every day. Pandemic has caused global social disruption. Many events around the world have been canceled or postponed. Universities, schools, kids’ playgrounds, businesses, shopping areas, and even worship services of various faiths have been affected by the pandemic, and they have been temporarily closed. Some cities and states even decided to shot down. Our lives have changed. Some have continued working online. Kids have distance education from their homes. We have been informed about how to keep our environment hygienic. Social distance and face masks have been serious steps to protect ourselves from the virus.

To sum up, the whole world has been affected by the pandemic, and lives have been changed. In this article, I will investigate what countries have suffered most from Covid-19 and how people have been affected by the pandemic.


## 1. What countries are mostly suffered by Covid-19?

> NBC news mentions “The new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, which killed around 10 percent of people who became infected. The SARS outbreak was contained within about six months, while the COVID-19 outbreak is only a few months old at this point. Approximately 35 percent of reported patients with MERS died, but there were significantly fewer cases than either SARS or COVID-19 during that outbreak.”

Even though the death rate of Covid-19 is less than the other epidemics, Covid-19 is the scariest pandemic and causes the most countries to take an emergency call action. It spreads very quickly and increases the number of patients faster, compared to other epidemic diseases. According to [The World Health Organization, WHO](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Dl7ag80nJH_sHp5D0ghUcz3wSyThWUj4#scrollTo=OUcqyz6pNAet&line=12&uniqifier=1) conducted an excellent survey and provided a very nice dataset to analyze and to see what countries are mostly affected by this pandemic. There are more than 100 countries in data and the period was used is among the first four months of 2020.

   ####  **Top 10-Countries which have the greatest number of confirmed cases**

Covid-19 was first seen in China. Many media reported almost every hour on how the epidemic was spreading quickly to other countries. The United State confirmed its first case approximately a few weeks after the reported outbreak in China. China has had a total of 82,875 confirmed cases since January 2020, and it has taken the 5th place. Italy, Spain, and Germany have been coming after the U.S

Even though some countries meet pandemic earlier than the USA, the data clearly shows that the U.S has the most confirmed cases.. 241,703 people have been affected seriously and some of them lost their lives. Indeed, there could be many reasons why the U.S has a greater number of cases such as population, geography, climates, social and economic dynamics, and so on.

## 2. Consequences of Covid-19 in the U.S

Since Covid-19 has been a part of our lives, we have taken serious actions such as closing all private and public schools, most businesses, restaurants, and shopping areas, limiting or stopping face to face communication, staying at home for weeks, and even shutting down some cities and States. All those serious actions and limitations on human life would have some consequences and effects on society and people’s lives.

### 2.1.1 Symptom of Depressive Disorder

I used the Covid-19 dataset from [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp) open data source, and this dataset is about the people who have confirmed symptoms of depressive and anxious disorders. Original data comes from the Household Pulse Survey run by the U.S. Census Bureau, and it is designed to provide an understanding of the pandemic on society, economy, and health. Five weekly periods were taken into consideration and participants were been asked how they feel the last 7 days. I have decided to investigate the relationships between disorder, age, and gender.

#### * Age

The age range is between 18 and 80 years old. There are 7 age groups and each group will be categorized based on weekly reports. Instead of case numbers, the mean case number is provided for each category.

The graph above shows that younger people show more depressive disorder symptoms compared to older people. To me, this is a very interesting result. People, who are around 25 years old, have more depressive symptoms compared to other weeks; however, there is a slight decrease in the number of cases for the same group age at the second week. Then there is not a significant difference between the weeks in the case numbers. I was expecting the case number might increase in people around 35 as more weeks pass. Only small numbers of cases are seen between the ages of 30 and 40 years old people. These results bring another question into our minds. Most young people are single and live alone. They mostly interact with friends and families outside. Thus, does limitations on social life cause more symptoms of depression on them? If you have any questions, you could reach the source [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm).

#### * Gender

The result we could catch from the graph is that the case numbers are significant differences between genders. Men have a much harder time and more concerns during 5 periods compared to women. For example, out of 100 male participants, 26.1 males have shown the symptoms of depressive disorder in the first week. Moreover, from the first week to the fifth week, the numbers of men showing symptoms of disorders are going up faster than that of women . Women’s case number has been increased by 2.2 while men go up from 26.1 to 27.4.

### 2.1.2 Effects of Covid-19 on society in the USA

I have also investigated another to look at the impact of Covid-19 on society. [The COVID-19 impact survey](https://www.covid-impact.org/results) is designed to provide national and regional statistics about physical health, mental health, and economic impacts and social dynamics. Participants are selected randomly above 18 years old all over the 50 states in the USA. Mental health and social dynamic questions are mostly concerned to find s statistical impact of Covid-19 on society and people.

#### * Impact of Covid-19 on Neighborhood relationship

> Based on the [news.google](https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=en-US&mid=/m/059rby&gl=US&ceid=US:en), the total confirmed cases in Newyork state is 392,700, and number of death is 30,844

New York state has the highest number of cases since the pandemic started in the USA. Thus, I choose New York state to see how seriously people’s lives are changed.

Almost 400 interviewers were asked how often they talked with any of their neighbors in the past. Also, during a typical month before March 1, 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading in the United States, how often they talk with any of your neighbors.
